Video Game Analysis

Launching a new video game can be a hit or miss. Heroes of Pyemoli has just been released, and we want to understand the typical customer base and the associated profits. Spending, purchase price, and total purchases are analyzed and stratified by gender and age categories. This program is a simple analysis of the Heroes of Pyemoli data collected, and is essential for future marketing decisions and ways to increase profits to its fan base. This could either be implemented when making decisions for video game add-ons or future video game ideas and releases. 

Summary of main findings:

1) Most purchases are made for ages 20-24 ($1114 for total purchase value) and most customers are male (about 84%). 

2) Purchase count wasn't always consistent for total purchase value, but the item with the highest purchase value also had the highest purchase count (Oathbreaker.) 

3) Males spent and purchased more than females. However, the average price (not total) was higher for females compared to males ($4.47 vs. $4.07.)
